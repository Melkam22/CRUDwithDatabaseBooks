# CRUDwithDatabaseBooks

A Book List with mongodb database and a full CRUD functionality. One can register the full information about the book such as author name, book title etc. and one can submit it directly to the database and in parallel the user could see the book list on the dom. The user can edit and delete the content of the list. In the future, I am planning to add search input on the book list in order to allow the user to verify whether the inserted book is already existing in the database or not.
